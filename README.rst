Want to help shape NixOS Weekly?
--------------------------------

NixOS Weekly is a community driven project. Everybody in NixOS community is
extremely busy and nobody alone can afford to monitor what is happening. The
only way to avoid burnout is to do it together.

Ways to contribute:

- **Contribute interesting links for next issue.** Best way to contribute is to
  open a Pull Request and contribute links / content for next blog post
  release.

- **Write script(s) to automate "stuff".** Not everybody is a writer and enjoys
  writing blog posts. But some of us are quite good at writing scripts that
  make our life easier. Look at the issue tracker for possible issues that
  require some programming skills.

- **Become an Editor.** For every blog post release there is going to be one
  person in charge and we call this an Editor. The sole responsability of this
  role is that blog post release happens on time and that we have an editor for
  next release. To become and editor all you have to do is volunteer.

  See `EDITORS.rst <./EDITORS.rst>`_

FAQ
---


Is there enough things happening in a week to have weekly news?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Probably not (yet). While calling this NixOS Weekly, we will have blog releases
every 2 weeks and after a month we will see if we need to change the frequency.
Until we try we won't know for sure.
