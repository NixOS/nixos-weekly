    We are just starting and are looking for help from community.


## Want to help shape NixOS weekly?

NixOS weekly is a community driven project. Everybody in NixOS community is
extremely busy and nobody alone can afford to monitor what is happening. The
only way to avoid burnout is to do it together.

Ways to contribute:

- **Contribute interesting links for next issue.** Best way to contribute is to
  open a Pull Request and contribute links / content for next blog post
  release. (TODO: add link)

- **Write script to automate stuff.** Not everybody is a writer and enjoys
  writing blog posts. But some of us are quite good at writing scripts that
  make our life easier. Look at the issue tracker for possible issues that
  require some programming skills. (TODO: add link)

- **Become an Editor.** For every blog post release there is going to be only
  one person in charge. This person will follow happenings in community,
  collect links and make sure that blog post release happens in time.

## Rules that editor should follow

TODO: write some guidelines for editors for now we don't have any but maybe we
      should have some



## FAQ


### Why did you write yet another static blog generator tool?

We couldn't agree what to use and we all love Nix. In the end it turned out to
be implemented in ~30 lines of code. You start wondering if Nix is not only
ment to be for package management, but also for static blog generating. :)


### Is there enough things happening in a week to have weekly news?

Probably not (yet). While calling this NixOS Weekly, we will have blog releases
every 2 weeks and after a month we will see if we need to change the frequency.
Until we try we won't know for sure.
