instead.

Some fun stats:

- ~ 80 new contributors (very inexact science this)
- ~ 60 new services

Reading
=======

- One long-standing issue in Nix has been the storage of secrets. Right now
  `many of our services`_ store their secrets in ``/nix`` where they are world
  readable. This means you can't have root-only secrets, multi-user systems are
  problematic, and if one of your services is compromised it can be used to
  steal all your other secrets. Eelco created an RFC for `encrypting secrets at
  rest`_.

- `Monte`_ is a dynamic language inspired by Python and E. It uses Nix, *under
  the hook*, for its `packaging`_. Worth checking out if you are writing a new
  languge and want to see how Nix help you.
